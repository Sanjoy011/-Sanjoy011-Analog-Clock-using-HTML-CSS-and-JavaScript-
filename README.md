Creating an analog clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a fantastic project to learn about front-end web development. Let's break down the process into steps:


Step 1: HTML Structure
First, let's create the HTML structure for our analog clock. We'll need elements for the clock face, hour hand, minute hand, and second hand.

Step 2: CSS Styling
Next, let's add CSS styles to make our clock visually appealing. We'll position the clock hands and style the clock face.

Step 3: JavaScript Functionality
Finally, let's add JavaScript code to make our clock functional. We'll use the setInterval() function to update the rotation of the clock hands every second.

That's it! You now have a basic analog clock created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Feel free to customize the styles and add additional features to enhance your clock project.
